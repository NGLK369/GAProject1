Project 1 Blackjack


Blackjack Game
This is a simple implementation of a Blackjack game. It allows multiple players to join the game, place bets, and play against the dealer. The game is played in the browser using JavaScript.

How to Play
Start the game by clicking the "Join" button. Enter your player name when prompted. The game supports multiple players.

Once all players have joined, click the "Start" button to begin the game.

Each player starts with a balance of $1000. Use the provided chip buttons to deduct chips from your balance and place bets.

After all players have placed their bets, the cards will be distributed.

The goal of the game is to have a hand with a total value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

Each player takes turns to decide whether to "Hit" (receive another card) or "Stand" (stop receiving cards). Use the respective buttons to make your choice.

Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their cards and plays according to the game rules.

After the dealer's turn, the game calculates the results and updates each player's balance accordingly.

You can play multiple rounds by clicking the "Next Game" button after each round.
